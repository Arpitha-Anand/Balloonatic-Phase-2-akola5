# Balloonatic-Phase-2-akola5
In this phase, we had to use Nodejs, Express, EJS which is very new languages to me.
It took some time for me to analyze and implement the requirement in the code, it was a very good hands-on experience where I came across many errors and learned how to resolve them.
It was very blank when i started, but once I started doing it felt very interesting.
I would like to explore more and give my best for phase-3.
